To host a Flask website on Firebase, you can follow these general steps:

Create a Firebase project and set up Firebase Hosting. You can do this by following the official Firebase Hosting 
setup guide.

Set up a Flask application that is ready to be deployed. This includes installing all necessary packages, defining 
routes, and creating templates.

Create a file named firebase.json in the root directory of your Flask application. This file will contain the 
Firebase Hosting configuration.

Add the following code to firebase.json:

json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "function": "flaskApp"
      }
    ]
  }
}
This code tells Firebase Hosting to use a Firebase Cloud Function called flaskApp to handle all requests to the
website.

Install the Firebase CLI by running npm install -g firebase-tools in your terminal.

Log in to Firebase by running firebase login in your terminal.

Initialize Firebase in your project by running firebase init in your terminal. Follow the prompts to set up 
Firebase Hosting.

Deploy your Flask application by running firebase deploy in your terminal. Firebase will build and deploy your 
application to Firebase Hosting.

Wait for the deployment to complete, and then visit your website's URL to see it in action.

That's it! Your Flask website should now be hosted on Firebase Hosting. If you encounter any issues during the 
process, refer to the official Firebase Hosting documentation or seek assistance from the Firebase community.
